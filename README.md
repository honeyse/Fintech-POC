        "name": "Banking API",
        "type": "banking_api",
        "description": "Core banking operations",
        "endpoints": ["/balance", "/transfer", "/history"],
        "authentication": "OAuth 2.0"
    }
]

# Run AI-generated tests
results = runner.run_ai_generated_tests(api_specs)

# Generate comprehensive report
runner.generate_test_report(results, "my_test_report.json")
```
